  aboutMe:
    "I am a Solution-Oriented Software Developer, passionate about creating applications that are not only functional but also deliver real impact and a seamless user experience. My coding philosophy places a strong emphasis on clean, structured, and maintainable code, ensuring the features I develop are efficient and scalable for the future. My greatest joy is breaking down complex problems and transforming them into simple and elegant solutions; I am adept at balancing powerful back-end functionality with intuitive front-end design, supported by solid experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, React/Vue, .Net, Node.js, and Python. As a keen learner, I actively follow industry best practices and the latest technology developments. I am currently interested in exploring mobile development with Flutter/React Native, and am always open to collaborating on any challenging and innovative projects.",
